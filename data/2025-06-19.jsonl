To make this process\nmore efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model\narchitecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,\n$\\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and\nlearning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with\nwidth (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for\nlarger models without additional tuning. While $\\mu$P showed impressive results\nin practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations\nwhen applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\\mu$P is the fact\nthat input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking\nthe width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally\nmuch larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical\nanalysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and\nsubsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics\n\\emph{interpolate between the $\\mu$P regime and another regime that we call\nLarge Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those\npredicted by $\\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal\nembedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\\Theta(\\sqrt{width})$,\nsurprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the\nliterature, and different from the $\\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\\mu$P.\nWe conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model\nfrom scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the\nembedding LR."}

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing\nfeatures within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,\nhowever, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or\npoor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.

AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning\nmodel to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the\nreasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified\nrule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers\nto compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as\nan auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy\noptimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\%\nrelative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a\n6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,\ncompared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but\nwithout the rule-based auxiliary reward.

In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction.

ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE", "summary": "Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,\ndata analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of\ntheir accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect\nvisualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information\nconveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual\nbugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause\nobvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data\ngraphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good\nunderstanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is\nessential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz\nlibraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz\nlibraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our\nstudy systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a\ndetailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in\nDataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,\nwhich necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.\nMoreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test\noracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in\ndesigning effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent\nadvancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of\napplying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show\nthat the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,\ndepending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not\nnecessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our\nmanuscript."}

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.
